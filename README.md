# monkey-interpreter

C++ implementation of the monkey-lang interpreter from the book [Writting an Interpreter in Go](https://theinterpreterbook.com) by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com), a lot of the code is modified to match my personal coding style and preferences.

**Archived**: some bad desitions about the lifetime management of the objects led to a bad implementation, everything got reimplemented and extended in [artichoke-lang](https://github.com/Erick3900/artichoke-lang)
